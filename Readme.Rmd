# Section 1

1. Provide a short name (either a single word or an acronym) for the analytic you plan     to develop. 

Boots

2. Provide a brief title (1-2 sentences)   describing - at the 50,000 foot level - what your analytic does.  Your title should be short and to the point, but should also be clear to an end user.
The analytic takes Defense Manpower Data Center(DMDC) data on troop numbers abroad for active duty military personnel and generates forecasts for the selected country or countries, provides accuracy statistics, a visual depiction of the forecasts including actual observed values, and projected troop numbers for the year or years of interest.  

3. Provide a description (2-3 paragraphs) of why this analytic data product will be useful for an end-user.  This description should address the following points (where applicable).

This analytic will be utilized by USTRANSCOM to better predict USTRANSCOM workload demands in coming years.  The features which my analytic will perform when complete are to import the data, tidy the data in the format popularized by Wickham, group the data by country, branch, order the data by year, convert the data to a zoo/time series object, implement forecast functions, plot the forecasts, provide accuracy metrics, provide forecast values, and confidence intervals for years of interest. The typical end-users for whom this analytic is being developed are analysts at USTRANSCOM/JDPAC.  Important knowledge/skills/abilities an end-user must have in order to utilize the analytic is a knowledge of forecasting techniques such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and possibly some dynamic regression models; however, the analytic will provide a basic description of what the model is and its key parameters and terms.

The analytic implements autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) forecasting models, simple exponential smoothing models, Holt models, and forecasting accuracy metrics.  This analytic is built upon \textbf{R} packages: *forecast, ggplot2 and tidyverse*.  End-users will access the data analytic product via the internet.  All data are available from the unclassified, open-source database maintained by DMDC.  There are no security concerns that need to be addressed.  There are no appearance/design constraints that the analytic must adhere to, but the goal is to provide a clean design with easy to use graphical user interface.
